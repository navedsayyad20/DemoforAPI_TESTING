CODING 


QA process (quality assurance)

1. manual testers (functional testers)

EXCEL, JIRA tool 

2. Automation Testers 

Any 1 prog lang (java, python, C#, JavaScript)
java + selenium, cypress, Robot FW, BDD cucumber , Mocha, Jasmine etc 

3. API testing 

Manually : postman 

Automation : REST Assured FW

Q. what is selenium ? 
Selenium is NOT a tool it is a framework (collection of JAR files) 

JAR files are a collection of . class files

   webapps(browsers) & standalaone         (chrome, firefox, Edge, opera, safari etc)

Selenium WEBDRIVER ARCHITECTURE

4 components :

- selenium client library :
It is the programming lang that we are using for automation scripts along with selenium 

- JSON wire protocol  (JSON- java script object notation) :

It is the format through which the prog lang code will get converted to  interact with browsers 

via HTTP : it is the protocol through which the converted JSON will interact with browser drivers and the respective driver will initiate the browser  

- browser drivers: 

they initiates the respective browsers 


- browsers :
use to run web apps (chrome, edge, FF, Opera etc )
